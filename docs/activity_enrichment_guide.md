# Activity Enrichment Guide

This guide covers the full pipeline for enriching Strava activities with proper names, match data, leaderboard rankings, and formatted descriptions. It operates in two modes: **Backfill** (one-time historical enrichment) and **Weekly** (ongoing maintenance after each session).

## Prerequisites

The following must be in place before starting:

| Item | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Strava tokens (with `activity:write` scope) | `strava/strava_tokens.json` | Refresh handled automatically |
| Synced activity history | `training/history/*.json` | Run `fetch_strava.py --sync` to backfill |
| eBadders match history | `training/ebadders_history.json` | Run `strava/parse_ebadders.py` to refresh |
| eBadders HTML export | Saved from `ebadders.com/24/players/10613/games/` | Re-export if new sessions exist |

## Overview

The pipeline has 5 stages, each building on the previous:

```
1. Classify → 2. Gather Match Data → 3. Generate Descriptions → 4. Review → 5. Push to Strava
```

### Backfill vs Weekly

| Aspect | Backfill Mode | Weekly Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Scope | All activities for a year | This week's new activities |
| eBadders data | Already in `ebadders_history.json` and merged into JSONs | Re-export HTML after Monday session, parse, merge |
| Photos | Parse leaderboard screenshots for rank data | Screenshot leaderboard before session closes |
| Naming | Assign counters from Jan 1 of the year | Continue from last counter value |
| Review | Full table of all renames | Quick check of 1-5 activities |

---

## Stage 1: Classify and Rename Activities

**Goal:** Assign each activity a name following the naming scheme.

### Naming Scheme

| Type | Pattern | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Morning routine (pre-2026) | `Foundation #K: Core` | All pre-2026 foundations are Core |
| Morning routine (2026, pre-Mar 9) | `Foundation #K: Core` | |
| Morning routine (2026, Mar 9+) | `Foundation #K: Kickstart` | Continues same counter |
| Calisthenics (Workout A/B) | `Calisthenics #K: [focus]` | e.g., FL & Handstand, General |
| Recovery (Workout C) | `Recovery #K` | |
| Corrective (Workout D) | `Realign #K` | |
| Monday badminton | `Hit & Run #K: Ranked` | Single counter for all H&R |
| Thursday badminton | `Hit & Run #K: Friendly` | Same counter as Monday |
| Saturday badminton | `Badminton: Sat session` | No counter |
| League | `League #K: vs [opponent] ([result])` | e.g., `vs LBA (1W-2L)` |
| Cycling, runs, yoga | Leave as-is | |

Counters are **per-type** and **per-year**, starting from #1 on Jan 1 each year.

### Steps

1. **List all activities** for the target period. For each activity, extract: date, day-of-week, sport_type, name, duration, photos, description.

2. **Auto-classify** based on sport type, duration, day-of-week, and name patterns:
   - Badminton + Monday → Hit & Run Ranked
   - Badminton + Thursday → Hit & Run Friendly
   - Badminton + Saturday → Badminton: Sat session
   - WeightTraining + <30 min → Foundation
   - WeightTraining + >45 min → Calisthenics
   - Yoga/stretching → Recovery

3. **Flag outliers** for manual review. Common outliers:
   - Short weight training on unusual days
   - Badminton on non-standard days (could be friendly, league, or casual)
   - Activities with ambiguous names

4. **Get Sky's input** on all outliers before proceeding.

5. **Assign counters** chronologically within each type.

6. **Generate final rename list** as a table for review. Include: date, day, current name, proposed name.

7. **After approval**, rename on Strava via API:
   ```python
   requests.put(f'https://www.strava.com/api/v3/activities/{activity_id}',
                headers=h, json={'name': new_name})
   ```

8. **Update local JSON files** with the new names too.

## Stage 2: Gather Match Data and Leaderboard

**Goal:** Collect match results and session rankings for Monday ranked sessions from the best available source.

### Data Sources by Date Range

| Period | Match Data Source | Leaderboard Source |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Jul 24, 2023 onwards | eBadders (`ebadders_history.json`) | Photos (screenshots) |
| Before Jul 24, 2023 | Photos (match result screenshots) | Photos (leaderboard screenshots) |

### Step 2a: eBadders Data (Jul 24, 2023+)

For sessions on or after Jul 24, 2023, match data is already available in `training/ebadders_history.json`.

**Backfill mode:** The data is already merged into activity JSONs via `merge_ebadders.py`. Verify the `ebadders` key exists on each Monday ranked activity.

**Weekly mode:** After each Monday session:
1. Wait for the session to be closed on eBadders (usually same evening).
2. Re-export the eBadders HTML from `ebadders.com/24/players/10613/games/`.
3. Run `python3 strava/parse_ebadders.py /path/to/new-export.html` to update `ebadders_history.json`.
4. Run `python3 strava/merge_ebadders.py` to attach the new session data to the activity JSON.

### Step 2b: Photo Parsing for Match Data (Before Jul 24, 2023)

For sessions before Jul 24, 2023, eBadders data does not exist. Match data must be extracted from photos attached to the Strava activity.

1. **List all Monday badminton activities with photos** in the target period.
2. **View each photo** to identify match result screenshots (Games tab showing scores).
3. **Extract match data** from the photo: for each game, record W/L, score, partner, opponents.
4. **Store in the same format** as eBadders data so Stage 3 can handle it uniformly:
   ```json
   {
     "wins": 3, "losses": 4, "win_pct": 43,
     "matches": [
       {"akash_won": true, "score": "21-16", "partner": ["Dom L"], "vs": ["Kean", "Harry S"]},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

### Step 2c: Leaderboard Data (All Periods)

Leaderboard/ranking data is only available from screenshots — eBadders does not provide historical rankings.

1. **List all Monday activities with 2+ photos** (the `_0.jpg` is usually the leaderboard).
2. **View each `_0.jpg`** to check if it's a session ranking screenshot.
3. **Extract:** session_rank, win_pct, avg_points, grade, club_rank, top_n_players.
4. **Store temporarily** — this data will be folded into the description in Stage 3.

> **Note:** Not all sessions have leaderboard screenshots. For those without, the rank line is simply omitted from the description.

---

## Stage 3: Generate Descriptions

**Goal:** Create a formatted description for each Monday ranked session combining all data sources.

### Description Format

```
[existing comment if any]

{W}W-{L}L ({pct}%) | Rank: {session_rank}

Games:
W {score} w/ {partner} vs {opponent1} + {opponent2}
L {score} w/ {partner} vs {opponent1} + {opponent2}
...

[Friendlies: (if any manually recorded)]
```

### Rules

1. **Preserve existing descriptions** — if Sky has written a comment, keep it at the top.
2. **Rank line** — only include `| Rank: K` if leaderboard data is available for that session.
3. **Games section** — sourced from eBadders data (Jul 2023+) or parsed photos (pre-Jul 2023). Each line: `W/L score w/ partner vs opponents`.
4. **Friendlies** — if manually recorded in the existing description, move to bottom in the same format.
5. **No description for non-ranked sessions** — Thursday friendlies, Saturday casuals, and league matches don't get auto-descriptions (no eBadders data).
6. **Missing match data** — if neither eBadders nor photo data is available, generate a minimal description with just the rank line (if available) or skip entirely.

### Steps

1. **For each activity with match data** (from eBadders or photos), generate the description string.
2. **Preview all changes** in a markdown file for review.
3. **Get approval** before applying.
4. **Update local JSONs** with the new description.
5. **Remove `ebadders` and `ebadders_leaderboard` keys** from the JSON — the description is now the display layer, `ebadders_history.json` remains the analytics layer.

---

## Stage 4: Review

**Goal:** Final review before pushing to Strava.

### Backfill Mode

1. Generate a full markdown preview with old vs new descriptions for every activity.
2. Present to Sky for review.
3. Address any corrections (wrong classification, missing data, formatting issues).

### Weekly Mode

1. Show the 1-5 new activities with proposed names and descriptions.
2. Quick confirmation before pushing.

---

## Stage 5: Push to Strava

**Goal:** Update activity names and descriptions on Strava via API.

### API Details

```python
# Update name
requests.put(f'https://www.strava.com/api/v3/activities/{id}',
             headers=h, json={'name': new_name})

# Update description
requests.put(f'https://www.strava.com/api/v3/activities/{id}',
             headers=h, json={'description': new_desc})
```

### Rate Limits

Strava enforces **100 requests per 15 minutes** and **1000 per day**. With 0.5s delay between requests, a batch of 50 takes ~25 seconds but may hit the 15-min limit if preceded by sync operations.

### Steps

1. **Always test with 2 activities first** — push, verify on Strava, then proceed.
2. **Push remaining batch** with rate-limit retry logic (wait for `Retry-After` header).
3. **Commit local changes** before pushing to Strava (local is source of truth).

## Year-Specific Notes

### 2026

Enrichment complete. Foundation suffix transitioned from Core (#1-9) to Kickstart (#10+) on Mar 9.

### 2025

- All Foundation sessions use `: Core` suffix.
- eBadders data covers all 20 Monday sessions (Feb 3 onwards). Already merged.
- 7 sessions have leaderboard screenshots (May-Oct). Already extracted.
- Hit & Run counter starts at #1.
- Counters are independent from 2026.

### 2024 (P2)

- eBadders data covers sessions from Jan 15 onwards (32 sessions in 2023-2024 range).
- Strava sync needs extending backward from Jan 1, 2025 to cover 2024.
- All Foundation sessions use `: Core` suffix.
- Hit & Run counter starts at #1.

### Pre-Jul 2023 (if ever needed)

- No eBadders data. Match results must come from photo parsing only.
- Leaderboard screenshots are the only data source for both matches and rankings.

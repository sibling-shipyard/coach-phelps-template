# Issue Template

Use this format when creating GitHub issues for workers. The issue should be a **self-contained prompt** — the worker should have full context from the issue alone, with no follow-up needed.

---

**Repo:** Always `<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>` — replace with your own repo once you've set it up.
PRs go on this repo. Reference issues with `fixes <your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>#X` in the PR body.

**Title:** `[ui-expert]` or `[bob]` prefix + concise description

**Labels:** `ui-expert` or `bob-the-builder`

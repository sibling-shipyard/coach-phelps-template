# Decisions (ADRs)

One file per durable, hard-to-reverse decision: `NNNN-kebab-title.md`.
Fields: **Context / Decision / Why / Rejected**, plus an `Area:` tag.

Rules:
- Add an ADR only when a choice is expensive to reverse, or a future agent might re-argue
  it. A decision nobody contests doesn't need one.
- Never rewrite an ADR to change its meaning. Supersede: add a new ADR and set the old
  one's `Status:` to `Superseded by NNNN`.
- Keep them short — five fields, a few lines each.
- Write in plain English — short words, no jargon; readable by someone outside the team.
- Central and tagged (not per-folder) so cross-cutting decisions have a single home.
- A PR that changes a locked/architectural decision must add or supersede an ADR here
  (Tech Lead checks this in review).

Seeded from `docs/scaling-plan.md` §4 (locked decisions).

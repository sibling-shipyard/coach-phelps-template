# 0003 — Start new users from a clean template, archive the original

- **Status:** Accepted · 2026-07-24 · Tech Lead
- **Area:** cross-cutting
- **Context:** New users need a clean starter template. The original repo was hand-built for
  one person, with everything tangled together.
- **Decision:** Build new users from a fresh, clean template repo. Archive the original
  instead of trying to reshape it.
- **Why:** A clean template is easy to copy and keep updated for everyone; dragging the old
  tangled repo forward would push one-person assumptions onto every new user.
- **Rejected:** Reuse/evolve the original → carries its mess and history to everyone. Keep
  the original as the template → leaves two competing sources of truth.

# Reference Interaction Validation

Validated against the committed [Widget Design Philosophy](./reference-interactions/Widget%20Design%20Philosophy.md), the [interaction prototype](./reference-interactions/Widget%20Interactions.dc.html), and the frozen [production acceptance contract](./reference-interactions-acceptance.md). Tests exercised the protected production Home at `/` for isolation and overflow, and the live-data review surface at `/home-v2` for the full interaction contract.

## Final contract results

| Surface | Verified behavior | Intentionally absent |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | Fine-pointer hover continuously scrubs the existing six-week trace, snaps to the nearest real week, and overlays a guide plus `{WEEK} · {LOAD}` paper chip. The card lifts 4 px with no geometry shift. | Point buttons, click state, tap pin, focus inspection, outside dismissal. |
| Commitments | All four cubes remain static; Badminton displays fixed `ALL`. | Scope toggle, `⇄`, count inspection, card click. |
| Weekly Plan | Existing chips move or swap through native drag/drop. Space or Enter picks up and drops; arrow keys select a destination; Escape cancels. Slots and card bounds remain fixed. | Persistence, `COACH DRAFT` accept/edit, fabricated projection values. |
| Training Activity | The four-month window pages one month at a time with correctly disabled ends. Dated non-empty cells use a fine-pointer-only outlined hover read. | Cell click, tap pin, deep link. |
| Calories | Fine-pointer hover follows the existing meter and uses the real cumulative daily series for actual-versus-expected pace. | Card click, tap state, expanded metric panel. |
| Quests and Coach Read | Static, source-backed glances. | Hover, click, tap, inline logging, thread surface. |
| VO₂ max | Available observations use the same nearest-point scrub model. The current unavailable state is entirely inert. | Empty-state card control or fabricated trend. |
| Recent Sessions | Rows remain static web receipts; `All activity` is the only control. | Row inspection, navigation, swipe, edit, delete. |
| Build Phase | Fine-pointer hover adds a quiet row wash and compact source-backed evidence badge. | Row click, tap pin, synthetic milestone math. |
| Touch and reduced motion | Hover enrichments remain absent on touch; optional lift/transition motion is removed under reduced motion. | Desktop hover leakage or attention loops. |

The deterministic headed-desktop and mobile-emulated suite completes **28 checks with zero failures**. It additionally verifies tooltip containment, fixed card and mark geometry, drag and keyboard swaps, hover clearing, click non-persistence, touch suppression, responsive visibility, route isolation, generated-data equality, and zero horizontal overflow at **390, 720, 1024, and 1440 px**.

## Route and data integrity

| Contract | Result |
|---|---|
| Protected Home `/` | **Pass.** One production dashboard root is present and `.wi-shell` count is **0**. |
| Review route `/home-v2` | **Pass.** The isolated Warm Instrument shell is present only on V2. |
| Current-week load | **Pass.** Generated `activities.json` contains two current-week activities with full Zone 1–5 observations. Independent recomputation gives **388.2478**, displayed as **388**. |
| Formula disclosure | **Pass.** The page reads `LOAD = Σ(MIN × ZONE 1–5) · BAND = 8-WK RHYTHM ±20%`. |
| Missing HR zones | **Pass.** Load is unavailable (`null`/em dash) rather than estimated from average heart rate; partial historical weeks do not enter the rhythm baseline. |

## Visual fidelity

The accepted no-interaction image is [`reference-rest-final-headless.png`](./validation-assets/reference-rest-final-headless.png). It was captured in a separate non-hovering Chromium session at **1440 × 861**; headed screenshots are reserved for active hover evidence because their compositor cursor enters the Engine trace. The rest frame contains no guide, chip, badge, or pinned state.

| Comparison metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Exact pixel identity | **99.854336%** |
| Identity above an 8-level color threshold | **99.985482%** |
| Mean absolute channel difference | **0.011628** |
| Card, chart, gauge, value, and grid movement | **0 px** |

The amplified difference map is effectively black. Remaining localized pixels correspond to the intentional removal of `⇄`, the animated sync glyph, scrollbar position, and subpixel browser rasterization—not moved content.

## Build status

`vite build` succeeds. The Warm Instrument source reports **zero TypeScript diagnostics**. The repository-wide TypeScript command still exits non-zero because of existing diagnostics outside this feature; none match `home-warm`, `WarmInstrument`, `HomeV2`, or the protected `Home` route.
